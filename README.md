Down the Hatch is a Javascript recreation of the Texas Instruments graphing calculator classic, *Falldown*, which itself is possibly an homage to *Fall Down 2600* by Atari.

### *Instructions*
The goal is to simply move left or right and drop through a series of breaks that appear on rising platforms.  The frequency of the rising walls increase over time.  Avoid hitting the ceiling for as long as possible.
