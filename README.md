### Down the Hatch

#### Background

Down the Hatch is a Javascript recreation of the Texas Instruments graphing calculator classic, *Falldown* which itself is most likely an homage to *Fall Down 2600* by Atari.  The original Atari version features 2 whilst the graphic calculator version as well as this js version is for single player only.  

The goal is to simply move left or right and drop through a series of breaks that appear on rising platforms.  The speed and frequency of the rising walls increase over time.  Avoid hitting the ceiling for as long as possible.
